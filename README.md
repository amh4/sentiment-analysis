## Planning

The programme started as a high level idea where we wanted to use Natural Language Processing to analyse user input.

After our initial research there were a few primary hurdles we had to overcome such as learning Python and test driving Python, integrating a JS frontend and Python Backend and from a users perspective how to we display the mathmatical output in an easy to understand format.
